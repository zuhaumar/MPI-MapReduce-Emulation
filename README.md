# MPI-MapReduce-Emulation

This project emulates the MapReduce functionality similar to Hadoop using MPI (Message Passing Interface). MapReduce is a programming model for processing and generating large datasets in parallel. In this project, we implement a simplified version of MapReduce using MPI to distribute computation across multiple processes.
